# 1. Introduction
Hello! My name is Adrià Pons and I am a second-year bachelor's student in video game design and development at the [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/) at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/en).

This website is built for information regarding my Project's II Personal Research lecture I delivered about Art & Audio Bibles in video games.

# 2. What is an art bible?
An art bible is a document or collection of documents that serves as a comprehensive reference guide for the visual and artistic aspects of a video game. It includes information about the game's overall visual style, concepts for characters, environments, other visual elements, graphic's specifications, etc. 

The art bible helps ensure that everyone involved in the development process is on the same page with regards to the game's visual design, ensuring its visual elements are consistent, coherent, and aligned with the game's creative vision.

# 3. What is an art bible for?

- To decide how the game will **visually look like**.

- To convince potential **publishers or investors** of our game first look and whether to invest or not.

- To follow an **artistic 'path' and consistency** during the development of the game.

- To help the team to **undestand the direction of art**, including new team members.

- To explain **how** and **why** stylistic decisions are made.

# 4. When and who should do it?

- **When?** The art bible of our project should be created after the GDD (Game Design Document) and before starting producing our game assets. This way we can avoid creating unnecessary assets and save time and effort.

- **Who?** The art bible of our project is normally created by the art director, who has a clear vision/path of how the team wants the game to look like. However, in the case of small studios, other team members with some art experience can also collaborate and help the art director with the production of the art bible.

# Introduction
Hello! My name is Adrià Pons and I am a second-year bachelor's student in video game design and development at the [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/) at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/en).

This website is built for information regarding my Project's II Personal Research lecture I delivered about Art & Audio Bibles in video games.

# What is an art bible?
An art bible is a document or collection of documents that serves as a comprehensive reference guide for the visual and artistic aspects of a video game. It includes information about the game's overall visual style, concepts for characters, environments, other visual elements, graphic's specifications, etc. 

The art bible helps ensure that everyone involved in the development process is on the same page with regards to the game's visual design, ensuring its visual elements are consistent, coherent, and aligned with the game's creative vision.
